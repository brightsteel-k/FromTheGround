# FromTheGround
 A Minecraft mod that adds new utility blocks and materials from the ground!

# Feature List

## Stones:
- Overhauled stone variants, updating the textures for andesite, diorite, and granite, and adding dolerite, lamprophyre, limestone, shale, schist, and gneiss.
- Added cobbled, polished, polished brick, and gravel variants of each stone type.
- New stone types and gravel types generate across entire biomes, eliminating the patchiness of vanilla Minecraft stone generation.
- All cobbled stone types can be used in recipes that use cobblestone as an ingredient.
- Stone tools get a custom texture depending on the stone variants used to craft it (works for stone, andesite, blackstone, deepslate, diorite, granite, dolerite, gneiss, lamprophyre, limestone, schist, and shale).
- All standard vanilla ores naturally generate with a texture that reflects the stone they are placed within.
- A new utility tool, the hammer, can be crafted with two sticks and five iron ingots. This item has the same durability as shears, and can instant-break glass blocks.
- Mining a cobbled stone block with the hammer breaks it down into its respective gravel. 

## Clay / Kiln
- Smelting clay balls in a furnace now gives clay bricks, a new beige item that can be crafted into clay bricks blocks.
- Clay bricks blocks can be dyed in a crafting table to all of the 16 standard colours, with unique textures that allow similar colours to be placed next to each other seamlessly. 
- The Kiln is a new furnace variant, similar to the Smoker and Blast Furnace, that specializes in smelting clay and stone. It can be crafted by surounding a furnace with clay bricks.

## Sulfur:
- Instead of flint, shale gravel has a small chance to drop a piece of sulfur. 
- Sulfur ore is a new gravel-like block that can form within shale gravel patches. Mining it has a chance to spawn a poison lingering cloud around it.
- Brimstone is a new block that forms in the nether, and can be broken with the hammer to obtain 4 sulfur. Brimstone can also be crafted from 4 sulfur.
- Sulfur can be crafted into sulfur blocks.
- Lighting brimstone, sulfur blocks, or sulfur deposits on fire will generate a deep purple flame, which inflicts poison to living entities within a certain radius unless they are wearing a turtle helmet. All silverfish and endermites in a radius are also driven out of infested blocks and inflicted with the wither effect.
- Sulfur flame also causes all tree leaves within the radius to rapidly decay.
- Sulfur can be crafted into sulfur torches and sulfur lanterns, violet variants of the vanilla counterparts.
- Wither skeletons have a chance of dropping sulfur on death. They also hold blackstone swords now.

## Saltpeter
- Instead of flint, crushed lamprophyre (lamprophyre gravel) has a small chance to drop a piece of saltpeter.
- Nitre is a new gravel-like block that can form within crushed lamprophyre patches, which functions as saltpeter ore.
- Saltpeter can be crafted into a block of saltpeter, a gravel-like block. Placing this next to lava or a block of molten saltpeter causes it to melt and become a source block of molten saltpeter, a new fluid.
- Submerging glass blocks in a bath of molten saltpeter causes the glass to become strengthened glass, a tougher explosive-resistant glass block.
- Flares can be crafted using x1 saltpeter, x2 charcoal dust, and x1 stick. These are throwable items that place a flare block wherever they land and give off a light level of 14 forever.
- A flare arrow can be crafted with x1 arrow and x1 flare. This is exactly what it sounds like.
- Monstrous hide can be crafted from x1 rotten flesh and x3 saltpeter. Four monstrous hide can be crafted together to make a single piece of leather.
- A redstone irregulator can be crafted from x2 saltpeter, x2 redstone torchs, and x3 stone. When this redstone component receives an input from its back face, itpasses the input signal out of one of its two sides at random.

## Bitumen
- Bitumen ore now spawn within sandstone in desert biomes.
- Bitumen can be crafted with coal to produce bituminous coal, which can cook 12 items each. These can be further crafted into bituminous coal blocks, which can cook 120 items each.
- 4 bitumen can be crafted into a tar ball, which can replace slime balls in common vanilla recipes.

# Farming
- Plants growing from a very large field of farmland has a small chance of causing a dessication event. This converts farmland around the block to dessicated farmland, which can no longer support live crops.
- Using saltpeter on dessicated farmland rejuvenates it.
- To prevent dessication events, players can craft a fertilizer box with wooden slabs and sticks. This unique farming block can only be placed on farmland, and its model reflects the amount of saltpeter within it. Saltpeter can be added to the fertilizer box by right-clicking it with saltpeter in your main or offhand. If a dessication event were to occur in a range around the fertilizer block and there is saltpeter within the fertilizer box, the level of the fertilizer box will instead be decremented by 1.

## Mixing Stand
- Instead of flint, limestone gravel has a small chance to drop 4 limestone powder. These can be recrafted into a block of limestone gravel.
- A mixing stand can be crafted using x3 stone blocks, x1 iron ingot, and x2 strengthened glass. This block looks and acts similar to a brewing stand, with three potion slots and a single ingredient slot. However, no fuel is necessary.
- Corrosion is a new potion effect that slowly damages a player's armour durability over time. If the player is missing armour slots, they instead take damage, though their health will not be decreased lower than 1 using this. The rate of damage inflicted is dependent on the level of corrosion inflicted.
- Instant Abrasion is a new instant potion effect that deals a large chunk of damage to a player's armour durability. The amount of damage inflicted is dependent on the level of instant abrasion inflicted.
- The bar beside each potion slot in the mixing stand GUI displays the sulfur concentration of the potion in the corresponding slot. One can add sulfur to water bottles to slowly convert it into stronger and stronger acid: first as brimwater, then sulfuric acid, then potent sulfuric acid, then concentrated sulfuric acid, then spirit of vitriol. These acid bottles can be thrown by right-clicking with hit, and will inflict entities near the impact point with varying degrees of corroding and instant abrasion, depending on the concentration.
- Mix saltpeter into sulfuric acid will increase the nitre concentration, which is also displayed in the mixing stand. Adding enough saltpeter will make a spirit of nitre. This acid bottle can be thrown by right-clicking with it, and will inflict entities near the impact point with instant abrasion II and set them on fire.
- Mixing bat guano into spirit of nitre makes spirit of ammonium. This bottle can be thrown by right-clicking with it, and it instantly grows natural plants (not crops) within a large radius of its impact point. It can also be crafted on its own to turn it into ammonium saltpeter.
- Mixing limestone powder with spirit of ammonium makes nitrochalk fertilizer. This bottle can be thrown by right-clicking with it, and it instantly grows all plants and crops within a large radius of its impact point.
- Mixing bitumen with water bottles makes bitumen fuel bottles. These can be thrown by right-clicking with them, and if a block of fire or a flaming mob is near its impact point it quickly spreads more fire and extends the mobs' burn times.
- Throwing sulfuric acid (or more concentrated variants) or spirit of nitre on gravel blocks causes them to break and drop their appropriate special item. (Like flint for andesite gravel, sulfur for shale gravel, saltpeter for crushed lamprophyre, etc.)

## Explosives
- x2 saltpeter, x1 charcoal dust, and x1 sulfur can be crafted together to make x2 gunpowder.
- Blowing up any cobbled stone block causes it to drop its respective gravel variant.
- Blowing up any gravel block causes it to drop its respective special item. (Like flint for andesite gravel, sulfur for shale gravel, saltpeter for crushed lamprophyre, etc.) 
- x4 ammonium saltpeter can be crafted with x1 bitumen fuel to make x4 ANFO, a fun new crafting ingredient. Ammonium saltpeter and ANFO can be crafted into a block of ammonium saltpeter and a block of ANFO respectively. Both blocks explode when they are broken by another explosion.
- ANFO charges can be crafted from x4 ANFO and x5 of any gravel variant. These are variants of TNT that only break sand, dirt, clay, gravels, and stones, making them handy for mining.
- Amatol can be crafted from an ANFO block, x4 TNT, and x4 ANFO. This is an extremely volatile explosive with a massive explosion radius.
- A stable detonator can be crafted from an amatol block, x1 ammonium saltpeter blocks, and x4 bitumen tar. This block is used in conjunction with blasting caps, blocks that can be crafted from x2 iron ingots, x4 obsidian,  and x2 ANFO. Blasting caps are explosion resistant. Pushing two blasting caps into opposite sides of a stable detonator block with pistons causes it to explode, breaking blocks in the vicinity. However, the stable detonator block does not break, allowing for a reusable explosion source.
