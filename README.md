# FromTheGround
 A Minecraft mod that adds new utility blocks and materials from the ground!

# Feature List

## Stones:
- Overhauled stone variants, updating the textures for andesite, diorite, and granite, and adding dolerite, lamprophyre, limestone, shale, schist, and gneiss.
- Added cobbled, polished, polished brick, and gravel variants of each stone type.
- New stone types and gravel types generate across entire biomes, eliminating the patchiness of vanilla Minecraft stone generation.
- All cobbled stone types can be used in recipes that use cobblestone as an ingredient.
- Stone tools get a custom texture depending on the stone variants used to craft it (works for stone, andesite, blackstone, deepslate, diorite, granite, dolerite, gneiss, lamprophyre, limestone, schist, and shale).
- All standard vanilla ores naturally generate with a texture that reflects the stone they are placed within.

## Sulfur:
- Instead of flint, shale gravel has a small chance to drop a piece of sulfur. 
- Sulfur ore is a new gravel-like block that can form within shale gravel patches. Mining it has a chance to spawn a poison lingering cloud around it.
- Brimstone is a new block that forms in the nether, and can be broken with the hammer to obtain 4 sulfur. Brimstone can also be crafted from 4 sulfur.
- Sulfur can be crafted into sulfur blocks.
- Lighting brimstone, sulfur blocks, or sulfur deposits on fire will generate a deep purple flame, which inflicts poison to living entities within a certain radius unless they are wearing a turtle helmet. Sulfur flame also causes all tree leaves within the radius to rapidly decay.
- Sulfur can be crafted into sulfur torches and sulfur lanterns, violet variants of the vanilla counterparts
- Wither skeletons now hold blackstone swords, and have a chance of dropping sulfur on death.

## Saltpeter
- Instead of flint, crushed lamprophyre (lamprophyre gravel) has a small chance to drop a piece of saltpeter.
- Nitre is a new gravel-like block that can form within crushed lamprophyre patches, which functions as saltpeter ore.
- Saltpeter can be crafted into a block of saltpeter, a gravel-like block.
